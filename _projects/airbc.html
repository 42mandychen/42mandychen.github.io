<p class="card-text text-left mb-0">AirBC is a web app that models a real-life
  airline company page. It allows public to view Airport, Flight, Ticket, and
  Route information, customers to log in and book tickets, and staff to manage
  database and view summary data reports.</p>
<p class="card-text text-left mb-0">I worked in a team of
  four with <a href="http://alisonwu.me/" class="intext-link" target="_blank">
    Alison Wu</a>, Harryson Hu, and <a href="http://www.rhysbower.com/" class="intext-link" target="_blank">
      Rhys Bower
    </a> for this project. During the time we
    used <a href="https://github.com/RhysBower/AirBC/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed" class="intext-link" target="_blank">
      GitHub Issue Tracker</a> to ensure good progress.</p>

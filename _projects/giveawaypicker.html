<p class="card-text text-left mb-0">Giveaway Picker is a web app that randomly
  selects winners from people who liked given Instagram posts. It's a project
  I'm currently working on. The app has authentication integration, <a href="https://reacttraining.com/react-router/" class="intext-link" target="_blank">
    React-Router </a> to provide search engine friendly URLs, and continuous
    integration with <a href="https://travis-ci.org" class="intext-link" target="_blank">Travis CI</a>.</p>

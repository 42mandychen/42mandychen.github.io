<p class="card-text text-left mb-0">It's this website you are looking at right

  now! After I got this domain, I revamped the original version to this current
  version, from scratch. I set up <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" class="intext-link" target="_blank">
    Jekyll
  </a>
  and now have my own <a href="{{site.url}}/blog/" class="intext-link" target="_blank">
    blog
  </a>.</p>

<p class="card-text text-left mb-0">WeDJ is a project that I developed with other
  three teammates at <a href="https://2016.nwhacks.io/"
  class="intext-link" target="_blank">nwHacks 2016</a>. It's a web app that
  allows people to vote for their favourite songs in gatherings, updates
  votes in real time, and automatically plays the most popular one.</p>

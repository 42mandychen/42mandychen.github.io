			<p>I'm studying Computer Science at
				<a href="http://www.ubc.ca/" class="intext-link" target="_blank">the
					University of British Columbia</a> (Vancouver, Canada) and graduating
					in May, 2018. Since May 2016 I've been a
				<a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/girlsmarts4tech/index.html" class="intext-link" target="_blank">
					 GIRLsmarts4tech
				 </a> coordinator, and I was an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for an introductory Computer Science course, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ubccpsc110/" class="intext-link" target="_blank">CPSC 110</a>, for a year.

			<p>When I'm not programming, I'm usually having a bubble tea, trying out food and taking pictures of it, or strolling around. Feel free to talk to her about computer science, food or little things in life.</p>

# Being an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant for CPSC 110 (Computation, Programs, and Programming) at UBC

I taught [CPSC 110 (Computation, Programs, and Programming)](https://sites.google.com/site/ubccpsc110/), an introductory Computer Science course at [the University of British Columbia (UBC)](http://www.ubc.ca/) as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant (TA) for three consecutive terms.

CPSC 110 is a wonderful introductory CS course at UBC, where students learn about basic but fundamental CS concepts such as recursions, binary trees, backtracking search, accumulators, graphs, and so on. The course is taught in [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/), which is a functional programming language and therefore, it is able to provide a new perspective to most of the students who were exposed to programming before their very first CS course at UBC.

I fell in love with this course when I was taking it. I enjoyed it when I was able to write a simple world animation program by myself, struggled when I needed to solve a graph problem using backtracking search and compound worklist accumulators, and ended up with 99% in the course. I was confident that I was able to teach this course as a TA, and I should share the fun and knowledge I got from this course to future CS students.

And I did.

I remember how I got worried when students all struggled with difficult materials, how rewarding coaching students through problems and seeing their happy faces, how hard it can be to brainstorm what I need to say without giving students the solutions directly, and how their thank-you’s lit up my day from time to time.

I was also able to see a lot of behind-the-scene work to run this course. As an introductory course, it was designed in a way that all students start from approximately the same level. And that’s why it is taught in Racket, a language that’s not popular. In addition to that, the course is not about learning the programming language itself at all. It teaches students to think and program in a systematic way by introducing them to programming recipes. It does not focus on teaching students how to program specifically in Racket as in the real world, being able to think as a computer scientist and program is not just about knowing some programming languages. What is more important is the ability to quickly pick up new skills based on existing knowledge, the understanding of important Computer Science concepts, and habit of writing code that’s easy to read. It is such a well-designed course that a lot of the CS students at UBC would look back and say, “wow, 110 was so useful.” (I didn’t make this up. I had this conclusion because I once went to one of the alumni panels and probably half of the people in that room agreed on this.)

It is a very organized course too. All the materials are accessible online, and there is sufficient practice always, along with people — TAs, instructors — to ask help for. For me, sitting in the weekly TA meetings was one of the things that cheered me up during the week. Usually a meeting started with a joke (yes we did), then we moved on to talk about lab of that week — how’s students doing, what are they struggling with, is there any issue, and so on. We were told me to not spoon-feed students with solutions (by trying best not to touch their keyboard!), and explain things step by step. I gradually grew the habit of talking out loud what I think because of TA-ing, as the train of thought is often valuable for students to see how they should approach problems. We shared during meetings how we explain some part of the lab that students were mostly having trouble with, and also some stories/memorable moments we had. Besides all the above, the meeting would end with a reminder that as TAs, when midterms were coming, school started to get busy, students were feeling demotivated, we should bring the energy into our lab.

TA-ing for this course has made me see things I have not thought about or seen before, and brought me to a group of amazing people. Definitely a great experience in my university time.

				From May 2016 to April 2017, I had been an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant
				for CPSC 110 (Computation, Programs, and Programming) at UBC.
				I learned a bunch and wrote about it in a
				<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2017-04-25-being-an-undergraduate-teaching-assistant-at-ubc.md %}"
				  class="intext-link" target="_blank">blog post</a>.

				I have been involved in <a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/girlsmarts4tech/index.html" class="intext-link" target="_blank">GIRLsmarts4tech</a> for
				two years and half, first as a logistics facilitator, then as a program coordinator. It is a Computer Science Department
				outreach program at UBC sponsored by Microsoft and SAP that teaches Grade 6 and 7 girls about Computer Science. The program mission is to spark and sustain interest in technology for girls through fun, interactive activities to cultivate future confident
				leaders. The vision is a diverse, equitable culture that empowers and fosters future generations of girls to embrace technology. It has been a great learning experience for me.

				As a GIRLsmarts4tech coordinator, I have also been a member of UBC CS Department's CODE (Committee for Outreach, Diversity and Equity). I have become more aware of diversity issues in the technology world as long as the efforts made to create and maintain
				a diverse tech world.

				I love <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" class="intext-link" target="_blank">Markdown</a>. Markdown is simple, yet so beautiful.
				My <a href="{{ site.url }}/blog/" class="intext-link"
				  target="_blank">blog posts</a> were all written in Markdown and generated with the help
					of <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" class="intext-link" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>. Feel free to check out some of my notes on <a href="https://github.com/42mandychen/UBC-Courses" class="intext-link"
				  target="_blank">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://gist.github.com/42mandychen" class="intext-link" target="_blank">GitHub Gist</a>, most of which were written in
					Markdown using my favorite Markdown editor <a href="https://typora.io/" class="intext-link"

				I like taking photos. As I’m walking around everyday mostly on UBC Vancouver campus, I took a number of pictures of UBC and Vancouver. Taking photos is my way of recording life, as well as a constant reminder that I should not gradually become numb to
				life. After all, there's so much to enjoy and appreciate about.
			</p>
			<p>If you’re interested in seeing my life through my eyes, check out my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/42mandychen/" class="intext-link" target="_blank">Instagram</a>.
				Feel free to take a look at my (old) collection of food pictures on my old <a href="http://blogs.ubc.ca/mandychen42/category/all-about-food/"
				  class="intext-link" target="_blank">blog</a> too, if you are not hungry at the moment. Otherwise I don't suggest doing that as my website is not edible.</p>

				I am interested in Japanese culture in general. I took two introductory level Japanese courses at UBC (JAPN 100, JAPN 101) and if you are interested, check out my <a href="https://vimeo.com/193218327" class="intext-link" target="_blank">video project</a>.
				Oh also, I usually crave for Japanese food from time to time. Please let me know (through any social media) if there’s any great Japanese food in Vancouver and I’ll love to know about it and talk about the places I’ve tried!
